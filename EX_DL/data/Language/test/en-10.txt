A series of ongoing protests began in Mexico on 19 August 2024, following the start of the legislative process of the 2024 Mexican judicial reform.[1]

Background
On 5 February 2024, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador proposed a judicial reform, claiming it would root out corruption in the judicary, which he had previously criticized as being controlled by a minority, complicit in white-collar crime, and influenced by external actors.[2] The plan was then supported by his successor, Claudia Sheinbaum.[3]

The reform would transform the country's judicary from an appointment-based system to one where judges are elected by popular vote.[4][5] However, the reform was widely denounced by opposition political parties, judicial workers, and international organizations, who claimed the reform would threaten judicial independence.[6][7]

Timeline
Beginning of the movement (19–31 August)
On 19 August, judicial workers across 29 states began an indefinite strike, closing several federal judiciary buildings. They set up banners and tents outside these sites to protest the judicial reform bill.[8][9] The Association of Federal Judges, representing 1,403 judges and magistrates, voted to join the strike by 21 August, with 1,202 members in favor.[10]

In response, President López Obrador acknowledged the workers' right to protest but dismissed claims that the reform would affect their rights, referring to the demonstrators as paleros ("shills"). He also defended the reform, stating that the goal was to eliminate corruption and privileges in the judiciary.[9][11]

On 26 August, hundreds of protesters gathered at Mexico City's Angel of Independence to demonstrate against the judicial reform, with no reported incidents.

On 29 August, access to the Supreme Court was blocked by protesters.

Legislative process (1 September – present)
On 1 September, the first day of the LXVI Legislature, numerous students from private and public universities protested in solidarity with judicial workers, gathering at Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City. Participants included students from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, the Escuela Libre de Derecho, and the Universidad Iberoamericana.[12]

The next day, a third of Supreme Court judicial workers voted to join the protests and strike, with 951 in favor, 116 against, and 5 abstentions.[13]

On 3 September, the day the Chamber of Deputies was to vote on the judicial reform, protesters blocked the entrance to the Legislative Palace of San Lázaro, prompting the deputies to move to an alternate venue at a gymnasium.[14] In solidarity with the protesters, the Supreme Court voted 8–3 to suspend its activities for one week.[15]

On 5 September, the Senate was blocked by protestors, prompting its relocation to an alternate venue.[16]

On 6 September, Norma Piña, the President of the Supreme Court, joined a protest in front of the Legislative Palace of San Lázaro.[17]

On 8 September, about 3,000 protesters gathered along Paseo de la Reforma to oppose the proposed judicial reform. Similar protests occurred across the country, while smaller counter-protests were also held on the same avenue.[18]

Storming of legislatures

Protesters during the storming of the Senate chamber on 10 September 2024
On 10 September, as the Senate was discussing the judicial reform bill, the session was abruptly halted around 16:26 CST when protesters broke through one of the glass doors and stormed the Senate chamber.[19] Security responded by spraying fire extinguishers against the protesters.[20] Although most senators were evacuated, some stayed behind to speak with the protesters. During the incident, a person from Civil Protection was injured and required medical attention.[21]

Following the disruption, President of the Senate Gerardo Fernández Noroña relocated the discussion to the old Senate building at the Casona de Xicoténcatl [es]. Protesters followed the senators to the alternate venue. Once Miguel Ángel Yunes Márquez announced his support for the judicial reform, securing the required two-thirds majority for its passage, the protesters clashed with Mexico City police stationed outside in an attempt to storm the building.[22] Despite these clashes, the bill was passed on the morning of 11 September.

On 11 September, as state legislatures convened to ratify the judicial reform, protesters stormed legislative buildings in Yucatán, Baja California, and Puebla, causing sessions to be postponed or suspended.[23][24]
