I'd always had a problem with grammer, at school it never really seemed that important to me, and to be honest, I never really realized how important it was to Felicity either; we'd never really writeen to each other before we married, and it wasn't until after teh honeymoon period was over that it really started to bother her; she would see notes I'd written and get angrier and angrier, until it progressed to violent outbursts; one day she had made dinner, and served wine, and I started to feel so very tired; I woke up tied to the table, with Felicity standing over me with a carving knife; she sliced into me and pulled out my intestines with a satisfied grin; as she took half of them and wrapped them around my neck, she pulled tightly, and I could feel the life draining out of me.
