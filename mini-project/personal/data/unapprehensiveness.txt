I'd always had a problem with grammer, at school it never really seemed that important to me, and to be honest, I never really realized how important it was to Felicity either; we'd never really writeen to each other before we married, and it wasn't until after teh honeymoon period was over that it really started to bother her; she would see notes I'd written and get angrier and angrier, until it progressed to violent outbursts; one day she had made dinner, and served wine, and I started to feel so very tired; I woke up tied to the table, with Felicity standing over me with a carving knife; she sliced into me and pulled out my intestines with a satisfied grin; as she took half of them and wrapped them around my neck, she pulled tightly, and I could feel the life draining out of me. 
"Now this," she said "is how you correctly use a semicolon."

The limo driver arrived a bit early to take the group of kids to their prom.
He hoped there was enough time to push the car into the lake before their parents remembered who he was. 
edit: Shit. I thought this was a good one, but I'm getting a lot of people who don't get it.
The story was kinda based off Dolan's Cadillac in Nightmares and Dreamscapes.
I wanted to have some crazy dude take revenge against some old tormentors by picking up their kids in a limo and locking them inside while he pushes the car into some water to drown them.

Rule details. Please read before posting.
Users, we have updated rules and added details. If you have not read them yet, please read them, they are important. This is a basic summary. Note that this is not a substitute to actually reading the rule details.


1. Attempt to tell a story.

Just posting something to the effect of "AAAAAAA"
is not going to cut it.

2. Must be two or less sentences.

Self explanatory. **DO NOT POST UPDATES OR OTHER JARGON THAT ARE NOT PARTS OF THE STORIES IN THE POST ITSELF.** If you violate this, we will tell you to fix this. Don't stretch grammar. If your story reads like seperate sentences, it is. Don't try to use semicolons to replace periods. It makes it read more than two sentences 

3. Must intend to be horrifying.
See rule 4.
 
4. Not in the form of a meme.

Do NOT post the lyrics to songs, or use jokes/dark jokes. If you think that it is too similar to a dark joke, ask specifically me (I'm a moderator of r/darkjokes aswell) and I will redirect you.

5. Be original.

Self explanatory. Direct reposting or plagiarism is grounds for a ban.

6. Must not contain political content.

No posts, hating on one side or another will be removed. US politics and others are stressful and controversial. Keep it out of here. People come here to be horrified, not converted to a political ideology. Do NOT mention politicians, Caucasus, or other politics that can be misconstrued.

These all apply.
