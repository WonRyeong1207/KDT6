[Announcement] Sad Stories Will Now Be Removed
As some of you may have noticed, recent popular posts have been more sad than horrifying. We've received some complaints about them. As this sub continues to grow, we feel it would be prudent to take a stronger stance at separating "horror" and "sadness".

Starting now, moving forward, we will start removing stories that are more sad than horror, and ask that they be posted in r/TwoSentenceSadness. Rule 3 has been updated which you can review in the [rule details](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/about/rules/).

There's a fine line between "horror" and "sadness" and there is often an underlying horror in the sad stories. Our guideline is that if the story makes you feel more like crying than of being scared, it belongs in r/TwoSentenceSadness. These include, but are not limited to, stories of depression, suicide, loss of a loved one, putting down pets, abandoned pets, unadopted pets, etc. Those of you that also frequent r/TwoSentenceSadness will notice that a lot of stories from here are cross-posted over there.

NOTE: Since this is on a moving-forward basis, we ask that you do NOT report stories posted before this announcement.

[Announcement] Rules Update
In an effort to clarify some of the rules, we have updated the wording on some of the rule details and added two new ones.

# Changes to Rule 1: Attempt to tell a story:

* We now explicitly state "Do not post links in the story."

Text that is automatically changed to a link, such as "u/" for users and "r/" for subreddits will be permitted as long as they make sense in the story.

* Added: "Low-effort posts will be removed."

These are for stories that are little more than "*A ghost appears. It says Boo!*"

# Changes to Rule 2: Be two sentences (or less):

* Added: "Sentences are not defined by punctuation. If the story *reads* as more than two sentences, it will be removed."

Many posts use improper punctuation. Either because the author doesn't know how to use them properly or they're trying to make multiple sentences appear as two. This also works the other way around: If the story has periods/full stops that should've been commas, then they might not be removed.

# Changes to Rule 3: Be intended to be horrifying:

* Added: "Inconveniences and annoyances are NOT horror."

# Changes to Rule 4: Not be in the form of a meme:

* Added: "Anything copied from r/Jokes will be removed."
* Added: "Posts that are framed as jokes will be treated as such."
* Added: "Posts that are direct copies of memes will be removed."

# Changes to Rule 5: Be original:

* Added:  "Re-posting your own stories may be allowed if the previous version is archived and you add "**\[Repost\]**" to the title."

We are now allowing you to re-post your own stories, as long as you follow the requirements. Failure to do so may result in **all** versions of the story being removed. If we discover this new rule is being abused, we may revoke it.

*On a side note, if you are reporting a story for being copied from somewhere, it would really help the mods a lot if you include a link to where you believe it was copied from.*

# Changes to Rule 6: Not contain political content:

* This rule now applies to both posts and comments.

We noticed that certain subject matters sometimes trigger a big debate in the comments, which often devolves into name-calling. While we do encourage discussion, we'd prefer it to be about the story itself rather than heated arguments outside the actual scope of the story.

# New Rule 7: Avoid Overused Tropes:

This was made as an official rule because it seems that many users don't notice, or are unaware of, the list of Overused Tropes.

# New Rule 8: No trolling, no spamming:

Honestly, this rule should not have been necessary, but we actually had a user who spammed the comments tell us that there wasn't a rule against it. So here we are. It's a very straightforward rule: Be respectful to each other. Don't troll. Don't spam.

&amp;#x200B;

Please note that these rules may be enforced at the moderators' discretion.

Contest 2020-1
###Theme: Superstitions come true
___

Rules:
All submissions are to be made in the comments.
All TSH and Reddit etiquette rules apply.
You are allowed to comment on other submissions, but you are not allowed to post overly negative criticism or break any Reddit etiquette rules in doing so.
Only one official submission is allowed. Replies to others' submissions are not counted, however any attempt to submit through this method will not be considered. If you break this rule by submitting multiple, all your past submissions to the current contest will be disqualified - but the following rule still applies.
You may replace your current submission with a different one, so long as you delete your first submission first. In the case that your submission is removed by moderators, you may use this to your advantage. However you may only do this before the deadline.
Moderation is manual, thus you will not be immediately notified if your submission is removed.
Moderation of submissions will halt 24 hours before the deadline and therefore no removals will take place. However if your submission does not fall in line with the rules, it will be disregarded nonetheless. If you submit during this period and feel that your submission is inadequate, please replace it immediately to avoid disappointment.

###A few things to note:

1. Contests are no longer ordered by their starting month but by their order in the year. This is because I can no longer guarantee that contests will always start on the last Monday of the month at 12 00 GMT. However, I will still try my best to stick to the schedule.

2. Did you receive an unexpected flair with no message coming with it? That's because you've won a contest before. Newcomers, winning a contest will result in being awarded with a flair corresponding to your achievement in previous contests.

3. The results may be hard to check, since they are often displayed upon the opening of another contest, but only on the corresponding contest itself, which is removed as an announcement. This makes space for the next contest, but also ensures all possible votes have been collated. Ensure that you check for results on the previous contest as soon as another pops up.
