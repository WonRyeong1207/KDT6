They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but I could only think of 'Run' when I found hundreds of photos depicting my dismembered mother in my Father's attic.

Sitting in my room, burning a scented candle to relax whilst applying makeup in the mirror, I seriously wondered if my boyfriend was losing his hearing since I’d had to clarify at least 3 times that I’d like a Bloody Mary when he’d called to ask what I wanted to drink.

[ANNOUNCEMENT] Got an overused trope? Let's hear 'em!
This community is growing faster than we ever thought it would, and we love it! However, there has been some concern with originality. In the past with former mods, some of your stories may have been removed for unoriginality or being an overused trope with little to no explanation. As such, we've decided to be much more explicit with what's considered unoriginal or an overused trope.

Below is a list of *some* overused tropes (i.e., a recognizable plot element that can be seen from a mile away) we've compiled over the years (also contained in our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules/overused_tropes)). Because of its overuse, we have either set an automod to remove, or will manually remove so that you all aren't reading the same story over and over. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but will provide new folks guidance on what to avoid or why we've removed their post.

**So how can you help? Read the tropes below. If we've missed something, leave a comment with an overused trope you'd like to see added to the wiki.** We'll chat it over with the mod team to add if we agree.

To reiterate! The below is not meant to be exhaustive, but we do want to provide clarity that we may not have historically. It's still up to the reviewing mod's discretion if something is unoriginal or an overused trope. We'll be applying these going forward, not retroactively.

Have fun, and fill us in on some unoriginality! (We'll keep this thread open as long as participation is active, then compile a new list for our wiki).

# "New" overused tropes to be added to the wiki:

* Any story taken from the [Two Sentence Horror TV show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6873926/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). (refer to our [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/comments/kwwo2f/announcement_two_sentence_horror_stories/) here as well)
* The point-of-view is from a pet, farm animal, etc..
* The main character actually has Alzheimer's/dementia/degenerative disease.
* The moon/stars blinked.
* The cloud is a mushroom cloud from a bomb.
* You have x's body part; it's the literal body part.
* The first sentence is innocuous; the twist is forced/coerced sex.
* The first sentence involves sleep paralysis; then "I could still move"/"felt it crawling on me"/"was still there when I could move again".
* The anesthesia didn't take and you're fully conscious.
* The train is actually going to the concentration camps.

# Legacy overused tropes that currently exist in the wiki:

* Anything even remotely related to Coronavirus.
* "The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door." These lines are taken from the story ["Knock" by Frederick Brown.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knock_(short_story))
* Any story that's a direct copy from the old [r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1iwylh/what_is_the_best_horror_story_you_can_come_up/) thread, or taken from any top scary story lists.
* You are what you eat stories.
* Stories that rely on a gimmick, such as obscured text, emojis, spoiler text, reverse text, etc...
* Most cannibalism stories.
* Most META stories (e.g., this sub is used as inspiration).
* I saw my reflection blink.
* I should have buried bodies elsewhere.
* Winning rock, paper, scissors against mirror.
* I live alone.
* I don't have a person/pet, or they're in another room.
* Person/pet has been dead for # amount of time.
* Second page/forgotten/missed test/homework/didn't study.
* Corrupted file/forgot to save.
* Portraits/paintings were/are windows.
* Get into Uber/your Uber is here.
* I live on (any number) floor.
* Carpeted bathroom/kitchen.
* No toilet paper.
* No milk for cereal.
* Forgotten chore.
* Stepping on Lego
* Stubbing your toe
* Phone not charged/missing charger.
