Excitement
I love the way she smells when she's laying in bed, and being so close to her doesn't help my excitement. I can't wait until she falls asleep so that I can come out from under her bed and taste her skin.

I smiled as I heard my father playing with my son in the other room.
Then I heard him come in from outside.

When I was a little kid I was dared to swallow a cockroach, egg-sack and all.
Ever since then, I've been spitting out live cockroaches every few months after they crawl their way up my throat.

Three Knocks
Three loud knocks caused me to spring out of bed, this was followed by bloodcurdling screams coming from the residents below me. As I was on the phones with the police, I heard the same three knocks at my window.

From one angle, I could see everyone who'd ever died in agony writhing as they relived their final moments on an eternal loop in the universe behind her eyes. From another, she looked just like her pictures on Tinder.

Crying, you tell her the baby is missing

First time
I woke up in my bed unable to move, accustomed to this I began to relax into the feeling, it would fade. A shadow in my periphery straightened "oh good, thought I put too much in the wine, first time jitters".

Marionettes

The Zoo
I chained up the gates and released all the apex predators inside the zoo just to see who really loved each other. Turns out love doesn't really matter in life or death situations, and many parents thought of their children as dead weight.

Serial Killer
My neighbor is a serial killer. At least that's what I told the police after burying my victim's bodies in his backyard.

The Perils Of The Sea
The ship's timbers creaked from every blow,  
as the tempest tossed it to and fro -  
desperately many a well-weathered hand,

With labored breaths and minds worried,  
through the crashing waves they hurried,  
fleeing not from the unrelenting wind  
but instead from lurking creatures finned.

The Pains of Commuting
On the bench of platform nine I awoke

for some anxiety the silence caused,  
then a voice, from where I could not tell,  
spoke softly, "now departing for *hell*".

I stared at the screen as the murderer paused, lifting the serrated blade high above her victim, then brought it down with such force that it pierced the sleeping girl’s chest clean through...
I screamed at my phone, begging my daughter to spare her little sister but, sadly, the remote cameras that we’d installed throughout our home did not include a two way radio.

Just posting something to the effect of "AAAAAAA"
is not going to cut it.

2. Must be two or less sentences.

Self explanatory. **DO NOT POST UPDATES OR OTHER JARGON THAT ARE NOT PARTS OF THE STORIES IN THE POST ITSELF.** If you violate this, we will tell you to fix this. Don't stretch grammar. If your story reads like seperate sentences, it is. Don't try to use semicolons to replace periods. It makes it read more than two sentences 

3. Must intend to be horrifying.
See rule 4.
 
4. Not in the form of a meme.

Do NOT post the lyrics to songs, or use jokes/dark jokes. If you think that it is too similar to a dark joke, ask specifically me (I'm a moderator of r/darkjokes aswell) and I will redirect you.

5. Be original.

Self explanatory. Direct reposting or plagiarism is grounds for a ban.

6. Must not contain political content.

No posts, hating on one side or another will be removed. US politics and others are stressful and controversial. Keep it out of here. People come here to be horrified, not converted to a political ideology. Do NOT mention politicians, Caucasus, or other politics that can be misconstrued.

These all apply.

10-Sep-01: Dear Diary, this afternoon I was sat in the garden watching Millie make chalk flowers on the pavement, when a glazed, faraway look appeared in her eyes and she began drawing things I'd never seen her draw before.

Since we moved into our house, my wife has been waking up in the middle of the night, staring at the vent on the bedroom ceiling and chanting a sequence of numbers over and over again before falling back to sleep.

Happy 50k subscriber day to r/twosentencehorror!!
A huge thank you to everyone on this sub! It's been quite a journey to get to 50k and I can't wait to see where we'll be a year from now.

A little background in my history here... I found this sub when it had 200 subs and have been loving it ever since. I became a mod shortly after subbing here because of my moderate knowledge of css which still shows on old school Reddit to this day. 

I saw this sub go from 200 to 50,000 subs in 3 years and all I can say is you are all amazing and the reason that I think we have one of the best subreddits on this whole site!

I also want to give a huge shout-out to all of my fellow moderators and the phenomenal job that they do! We could not be where we are without them.

So again, thank you, and I can't wait to see where we go from here!

[Discussion] Revisiting the List of Overused Tropes
Hi everyone,

Over the past little while, there has been some discussion of revisiting and possibly editing our list of overused tropes. Overused tropes are stories or variations of stories that we remove due to their over usage.

On the sidebar you can find the current list of tropes to avoid. We are putting a call out the community to help us in revisiting this list.

If there are stories that you think are overused, let us know in the comments.

Thank you to all of you from the TwoSentenceHorror mod team!

Christmas Contest 2018.
It’s the most wonderful time of the year once again, and even The Elder Gods seem to be getting into the holiday cheer! They’re using this newfound generosity to maybe not awaken and enslave you all for another couple years. So while we continue to countdown the days until our inevitable assimilation, why not have another contest? 

We at the mod team want to hear about the darker side of gift giving (in two sentences of course). Put your entries in the comment section, and we’ll pick some of the best to gift some shiny new flairs. Even thirdsentencehappy comments will be taken into consideration, if that’s what you’re into. The contest will be running until New Year’s Eve, so have fun, and don’t get to stressed if you don’t have much free time to post before Christmas :)

Merry Christmas everyone, and we look forward to reading your stories :)

**TL;DR:** You have until New Year’s Eve to show us the dark side of gift giving, in 2 sentences or less.
