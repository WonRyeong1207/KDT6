Hello all, this is your friendly neighborhood cult leader speaking. I appreciate all of the applications to join our burgeoning religion, and while I've had to deny a few who thought this was a joke, I've been very impressed by the quality of applicants. You'll be hearing from me very soon.

On another note, this has been our first month since going off of manual mode, and we really appreciate the help you all have given the moderation team by reporting stories that you believe go against our rules. This method takes a little more effort on your part, but it allows the mod team to live our lives and for your stories to be posted more rapidly. We ask that you continue to be good community members and stewards of the subreddit. 

# ANNOUNCEMENTS

* Please continue to report rule-violating stories. If you're not sure if something breaks the rules, send us some modmail or just report it and let us figure it out.
* We do continue to see low-effort, spammy, and troll posts on TSH. If we find you posting these, you will receive warnings via our [three-strike system](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules#wiki_red_dot_warnings.3A) and may be banned if you receive too many strikes.

# JULY 2022 CONTEST PROMPT

Our prompt for this month, suggested by the always wonderful /u/Outside_Normal in our Discord, is **Greek Gods/Goddesses**. Your story must start with **\[JUL22\]** in the title and must contain a mention of one of the members of the Greek pantheon. Note that this does not include the various creatures of Greek mythology, such as satyrs or centaurs, nor characters such as Hercules, Orpheus, or Achilles. We're looking for Gods here. 

**Properly formatted contest July 2022 examples:**

&gt;\[JUL22\] Zeus was has a bunch of lightning bolts. This is the second sentence.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[JUL22\] This is the first sentence. Aphrodite is the most beautiful woman in the world.

**Improperly formatted contest July 2022 examples that will be removed:**

&gt;\[JULY22\] The tag is not correct. I did not use the prompt at all.  
&gt;  
&gt;In \[JUL2022\], the tag is still incorrect. The tag wasn't in the first part of the story, either.

**JULY CONTEST RULES:**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting, language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

**1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places:** You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the 2SH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.

**7 honorable mentions**: Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

We again want to say thank you for all the help that you all give us by reporting posts that you feel violate the rules; we wouldn't be as effective without your help!

# ANNOUNCEMENTS

* Please continue to report rule-violating stories. If you're not sure if something breaks the rules, send us some modmail or just report it and let us figure it out.
* We do continue to see low-effort, spammy, and troll posts on TSH. If we find you posting these, you will receive warnings via our three-strike system and may be banned if you receive too many strikes.
* Plagiarism will result in a permaban! If you copy and paste a story or directly rip off a piece of media, you may be immediately banned from our subreddit. We have a zero-tolerance policy.
* As always, read the sidebar rules and check out our Discord for more info!

# August 2022 Contest Prompt

In honor of summer time, the theme for this month's contest will be **heat**. Stories must begin with **\[AUG22\]** and contain mention of the word "heat" or the concept of heat. ***PLEASE NOTE:*** **Leaving a child in the car during the summer is considered an overused trope. Please refrain from submitting posts that involve this theme.**

Properly formatted contest August 2022 examples:

&gt;\[AUG22\] In the heat of the moment, I wrote a sentence. This is the second sentence.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[AUG22\] This is the first sentence. It sure is hot outside

Improperly formatted contest August 2022 examples that will be removed:

&gt;\[AUGUST22\] The tag is not correct. I did not use the prompt at all.  
&gt;  
&gt;In \[AUG2022\], the tag is still incorrect. That's not hot.

**AUGUST CONTEST RULES:**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting, language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

**1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places:** You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the 2SH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.

**7 honorable mentions:** Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

**Contest ends on August 31, 2022 @ 11:59pm (GMT)**

Any questions should be made below in the comments, within our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6), or a note on [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror).

We're looking forward to seeing where we'll go next! Anyway, on with the announcements!

# ANNOUNCEMENTS

* Please continue to report rule-violating stories. If you're not sure if something breaks the rules, send us some modmail or just report it and let us figure it out.

# September 2022 Contest Prompt

In honor of our amazing achievement, the theme for this month's contest will be **millions**. Stories must begin with **\[SEP22\]** and contain the word "millions". Make sure you use "millions" plural; "million" singular does not count!

***PLEASE NOTE:*** **Holocaust stories are considered an overused trope. Please refrain from submitting posts that involve this theme.**

Properly formatted contest September 2022 examples:

&gt;\[SEP22\] Millions of miles away, I wrote a sentence. This is the second sentence.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[SEP22\] This is the first sentence. My cult numbers in the millions.

Improperly formatted contest September 2022 examples that will be removed:

&gt;\[September22\] The tag is not correct. I did not use the prompt at all.  
&gt;  
&gt;In \[SEP2022\], the tag is still incorrect. We only have a million followers.

**SEPTEMBER CONTEST RULES:**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting, language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

**1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places:** You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the 2SH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.

OCTOBER ANNOUNCEMENT + SEPTEMBER WINNERS
Our wretched cult leader, u/Shindig_, is off celebrating his libation ceremony with his lifetime consort (read: dude's getting married!), so I've taken the mantle to give you underlings some updates!

# ANNOUNCEMENTS

* Make sure to revisit the sidebar and read our rules and [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules/)! Quick reminder: it's two sentence (*or less*) horror. Also, just because you use commas instead of periods, or your sentences are between quotations, it still counts as more than two sentences!
* Any intentionally low-quality/low-effort posts will be considered trolling and result in a strike. Check out the wiki and our 3 strike and your permabanned rule for further details.
* Please continue to report rule-violating stories. If you're not sure if something breaks the rules, report it anyway and let us mods sort it out.
* Plagiarism will result in a permaban! If you copy and paste a story or directly rip off a piece of media, you may be immediately banned from our subreddit. We have a zero-tolerance policy.
* As always, read the sidebar rules and check out our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6) for more info!

# October 2022 Contest Prompt

To commemorate (or commiserate) with our cult leader's new nuptials, the theme for this month's contest will be **love and marriage**. Stories must begin with **\[OCT22\]** and contain the **theme of love and marriage.** You DO NOT need to use those words explicitly, but it must revolve around love and marriage.

***NOTE!!!:*** Please remember our rule against sexualizing minors as those will be removed and your account will obtain a strike. Additionally, at this point, incest is hovering on overused trope territory, so let's be more creative than family-members-marrying-House-of-Dragon-Game-of-Thrones-style!

Properly formatted contest October 2022 examples:

&gt;\[Oct22\] Our cult leader loves the cult. This is the second sentence.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[OCT22\] This is the first sentence. Our cult leader married his succubus.

Improperly formatted contest October 2022 examples that will be removed:

&gt;\[OCT 2022\] The tag is not correct. I did not use the prompt at all.  
&gt;  
&gt;In \[October22\], the tag is still incorrect and not the very first part. Marriage and love is lovely.

**OCTOBER CONTEST RULES:**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting, language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

**1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places:** You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the 2SH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.

**7 honorable mentions:** Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

**Contest ends on October 31, 2022 @ 11:59pm (GMT)**

Any questions should be made below in the comments, within our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6), or a note on [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror).

NOVEMBER ANNOUNCEMENT + OCTOBER WINNERS
Apologies for my lateness in updating you all! I'm afraid that the month-long celebration of my eternal union to my consort were a bit wild, and I took an extra day to recover. For all interested, the libations were free-flowing, much blood was spilt in the honor of our true Lord of Shadow, and a good time was had by all (well, *most...*).

# ANNOUNCEMENTS

* Make sure to revisit the sidebar and read our rules and wiki! Quick reminder: it's two sentence (or less) horror. Also, just because you use commas instead of periods, or your sentences are between quotations, it still counts as more than two sentences!
* Any intentionally low-quality/low-effort posts will be considered trolling and result in a strike. Check out the wiki and our 3 strike and your permabanned rule for further details.
* Please continue to report rule-violating stories. If you're not sure if something breaks the rules, report it anyway and let us mods sort it out.
* Plagiarism will result in a permaban! If you copy and paste a story or directly rip off a piece of media, you may be immediately banned from our subreddit. We have a zero-tolerance policy.

# November 2022 Contest Prompt

As, in the United States, we gather to sacrifice the sacred bird in order to appease the harvest gods (that was my understanding of the festival, anyway), so we shall gather to sacrifice our time and talents for the entertainment of the masses. The theme this month is **sacrifice**. Stories must begin with \[NOV22\] and contain either the word **sacrifice** or the concept itself.

***Note!!!:*** Please remember that stories revolving around the sacrifice of oneself for a loved one may be considered more sad than horrifying if there are insufficient levels of horror. Make sure to sprinkle in some scary stuff, or take your idea to r/TwoSentenceSadness !

Properly formatted contest November 2022 examples:

&gt;\[NOV22\] I hold the knife over the sacrifice. This is my second sentence.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Nov22\] This may be my first sentence. I sacrifice my life to the demon.

Improperly formatted contest November 2022 examples:

&gt;\[November 2022\] The tag is not correct. I've sacrificed my chance at a prize.  
&gt;  
&gt;In \[Nov22\], I got the tag right, but it's not at the beginning. I also don't mention the theme at all.

**November Contest Rules**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting, language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

*1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places*: You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the 2SH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.

*7 honorable mentions*: Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

*Contest ends on November 30, 2022 @ 11:59pm (GMT)*

Any questions should be made below in the comments, within our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6), or a note on [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror).
