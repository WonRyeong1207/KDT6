JANUARY 2022 ANNOUNCEMENT + DECEMBER WINNERS!
Another year, but is it really? It's like 2020 all over again, ain't it? More like... more like 2020 too, am I right? Anyway.

# ANNOUNCEMENTS

* You may have noticed a few changes in the past month. You're not going crazy! Due to a Twitter account that gathered two sentence horror stories they felt were poorly constructed, an influx of poor quality troll posts hit the sub. So we implemented a couple new things to help keep the nature of this sub to what it was meant to be: horrifying!
   * EVERY post now goes through manual review by one of our mods, so you won't see your story on the sub until it's reviewed and approved.
   * Any post that purposely and obviously is a troll attempt will not make it on the sub, and you may be permanently banned from participating.
* We're still sticking with the three strike (🔴) system otherwise.
   * A 🔴 is a warning if you violate trolling, spamming, borderline stealing, or sexualizing minors. Three of those and you're permabanned. If the infraction is severe, it is the mod's discretion to bypass and permaban right out. Remember, **Plagiarism will result in a permaban!**
* Check out our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6) if you want to chat to other folks in the community, run a story by us before you submit, or want to say random things to random people in a random server.

# MARCH 2022 CONTEST PROMPT:

Have you ever thought to yourself, "Self, this world would be awesome if only everybody stopped being dicks to each other"? We do all the time, so for this month's contest, let's create them hypotheticals.

For March's contest, your story must start with **\[MAR22\]** in the title, and contain the words "**if only**" somewhere in your story to qualify.

**Properly formatted contest March 2022 examples:**

&gt;\[MAR22\] If only this was the the first sentence as the title. This is the second sentence.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[MAR22\] This is the first sentence. The second sentence contains if only.

**Improperly formatted contest March 2022 examples that will be removed:**

&gt;\[MARCH 22) The tag is incorrect. And we didn't use the prompt at all.  
&gt;

APRIL ANNOUNCEMENT + MARCH WINNERS!
Yes, yes. We're late. Sorry, was too busy placing pixels on a canvas that would immediately get colored over. Anyway.

#  ANNOUNCEMENTS

* Please check out the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules) where our three strike (🔴) system rules are now stored. Three of those, and you're permabanned.
* If you feel a story violates any of our rules, please report them!
* As always, read the sidebar rules and check out our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6) for more info!
* Our **manual approval for all stories** is still in place as a way to combat the purposely low quality stories we've seen over the past couple months (hoping to turn it off soon!), so if you don't immediately see your story posted and haven't received notice it was removed, it's still in review.
* **Please welcome our new mod,** [**u/Shindig\_**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shindig_/)**!** A little about Shindig\_: he hails from Nebraska, born in darkness and bile, and joined our ranks after leading the Cult of Infernal Names but left because they were too soft. Jokes. I would never say anyone hails from Nebraska.

# APRIL 2022 CONTEST PROMPT:

Here's a reason to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6) \-- we got some feedback the last contest was a bit too restrictive so we said, "Oh yeah? You think you could come up with something?" and they did! Thanks to u/Alx_xlA for April's contest.

For this month's prompt, your story must start with **\[APR22\]** in the title, and be about a **card game**. It does not need to contain the words "card game", just needs to be about it.

**Properly formatted contest April 2022 examples:**

&gt;\[APR22\] I played blackjack. This is the second sentence.  
&gt;\[Apr22\] This is the first sentence. We played poker.

**Improperly formatted contest April 2022 examples that will be removed:**

&gt;\[APRIL 22) The tag is incorrect. And we didn't use the prompt at all.  
&gt;We play cards \[APR 22\]. The tag has an improper space, and wasn't the very first part of the story.

**APRIL CONTEST RULES:**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting, language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

**1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places:** You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the 2SH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.

**7 honorable mentions**: Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

**Contest ends on April 30, 2022 @ 11:59pm (GMT)**

Any questions should be made below in the comments, within our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6), or a note on [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror).

# JUNE 2022 CONTEST PROMPT:

On our Discord, we've been trying to come up with a theme for this month's contest. **Simubaya** said they were curious about the new theme. And that got me thinking... June's prompt will be **curiosity.** Your story must start with **\[JUN22\]** in the title, and include a variation of the word "curious."

**Properly formatted contest June 2022 examples:**

&gt;\[JUN22\] Curiosity killed the cat. This is a second sentence.  
\[Jun22\] This is the first sentence. I'm curious about the second sentence.

**Improperly formatted contest June 2022 examples that will be removed:**

&gt;\[JUNE 22\] The tag is not correct. And I don't use the prompt at all.  
Hello, \[JUN2022\] The tag is still incorrect. And the tag wasn't the very first part of the story.

**JUNE CONTEST RULES:**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions  that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of  the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries  that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to  fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting,  language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners  will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a  tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

**1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places:**  You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the  2SH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your  flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning  stories.

**7 honorable mentions**: Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

**Contest ends on** **June 30, 2022 @ 11:59pm (GMT)**
