APRIL 2020 ANNOUNCEMENT - PLEASE READ!
**APRIL FOOLS! (Gotcha, didn’t we?)**

Welcome to Two Sentence Horror! Whether you’re new here or a regular visitor, we would appreciate it if you would take the time to read through the following announcement, because we've made a few changes:

**DISCORD:**

Two Sentence Horror now has a Discord server! If you’re unfamiliar with Discord, it’s a live chat app. You’ll be able to chat with other members and even moderators. Our own moderator, u/two_sentence_critic,  will be hosting a valuable workshop where you can hone your skills as a writer. Available via web browser or as an app. You will need to create an account to join. You can find it here: [https://discord.gg/HYSbZ5C](https://discord.gg/HYSbZ5C)

**REDESIGN:**

We’ve made some cosmetic changes to Two Sentence Horror. We hope that you enjoy the new look! If the changes do not display correctly on your device, please contact us via modmail.

**AUTOMOD:**

Our new automoderator has been programmed to attempt to remove existing tropes, ALL coronavirus references, and stories or comments posted by users whose accounts are less than 3 days old. Posts or comments made by users with less than 10 positive post karma or 10 positive comment karma will be removed automatically.

We’ve added a bot that now restricts the amount of stories our authors may submit. The current limit is 3 stories per 24 hours.

While we’ve done our best to ensure the reliability of the automod and the bot, bugs are inevitable. If you feel the automoderator or bot has made an error, please contact us via modmail and include a link to your post.

**PROBLEM USERS &amp; BANS:**

Due to the increasing amount of trolls and poor behavior, we’ve added a deterrent: If a moderator finds your behavior in need of a warning, you may receive a red dot flair next to your name. This is your first strike. If you are warned a second time, you will receive two red dots. Your third strike is an automatic ban, the length to be determined at moderator discretion. **PLEASE NOTE:** If your behavior is severely poor, you might NOT receive a warning at all, and be banned immediately! So, be nice!

**TRIGGER WARNINGS:**

Two Sentence Horror is a place for anyone to submit a fictional horror story. Stories and/or comments may possibly contain horrific thematic elements; including, but not limited to murder, suicide, gore, rape, child abuse, incest, and death. You may encounter insensitivity, slurs and coarse language. Remember, fiction is make-believe, and any stories or comments you might find within are nothing more than a figment of the writer’s imagination, and in no way represent the personal views of this subreddit, or the moderation team. ***WE DO NOT AND WILL NOT PROVIDE TRIGGER WARNINGS! ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!***

**CORONAVIRUS STORIES:**

We’ve seen an ever-increasing amount of Coronavirus stories. THEY ARE PROHIBITED!  We now have an automoderator that will remove stories containing certain keywords. (Some of these are: *coronavirus, virus, quarantine, and pandemic*.) Stories that INDIRECTLY reference Coronavirus will be removed at moderator discretion. Posting a story that attempts to avoid the restriction can (and most likely will) result in a ban.

**(Stories that are automatically removed will only be reviewed upon request at the moderation team’s convenience.**)

**OVERUSED TROPES DEFINED:**

A trope is a commonly recurring literary and rhetorical device, motif or cliché in creative works. We remove a lot of the same re-worded stories. Please become familiar with our policy on tropes. Please note that the tropes on the sidebar are only examples, and is not a thorough list. The rule of thumb is: If you’ve heard your story elsewhere, it’s probably a trope.

**NEW MONTHLY CONTEST:**

Beginning April 2020, we will be hosting a new contest every month. The new format will provide for voting by the readers via upvotes. An announcement regarding the new contest is coming soon!

**Thank you for coming by! Enjoy yourself!**

 \- r/TwoSentenceHorror **moderation team.**

APRIL CONTEST 2020!
New subreddit, new contests! The moderator team has decided to redesign contests together with the changing subreddit. What better way to begin than with a theme of change?

___

###Theme: Metamorphosis

___

###New contest mechanics

Submissions are now made as text posts, and to differentiate them,  a [TAG] must be added to posts to identify them as an entry. Each user is only entitled to one per day though, so use your chance wisely!
Moderators will no longer intervene; users get to decide who wins! The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
___

### FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION:

Contest submissions are now done as post submissions, instead of comments.

To enter the contest, simply add the contest tag at the beginning of your story, **exactly** as it appears here, **including** the brackets: [MORPH] For example, your title should appear this way:  “[MORPH] Once upon a time there was a story.”

You may **only** enter the contest **once** per day. Our new bot restricts all users to 3 posts per day. Your story counts as one of those three. Choose wisely, because once you’ve submitted your contest story for the day, it’s entered.

Submissions which don't fit the theme will be disqualified.

PLEASE NOTE: **If you edit your story after posting it, your story will be disqualified.** If you’ve made a mistake in your story, you may delete it and post it again the following day, so double-check your stories for errors before you submit them!

If you add a contest tag to more than one of your three daily stories, **all** of them will be disqualified.

**Winners will be decided by total upvotes.** There will be a total of 10 winners. In the unlikely event of a tie, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker. 

* 1st Place:  A special prize from the mod team, to be announced later. A custom personal flair, and your story will receive a fancy flair as well!    
* 2nd and 3rd Place: A custom personal flair, and a fancy flair for your story!
* 7 honorable mentions: Story links will appear on the winners page!

Contest ends on **30 April, 23 59 GMT**. Good luck!

Suggestions and inquiries are welcome in the comments and modmail :)

Q&amp;A:

Q: Where is the March contest and results?

A: We put it in the sidebar. We also decided that the contest shouldn't have winners, as that is unfair to everyone else. Sorry about that.

Q: Does it count if we typed MORPH but forgot the square brackets?

A: No. Be careful next time.

MAY CONTEST 2020
It's that time of the month again! Why not do something a little more difficult this time? For the contest, we shall start with a phrase instead...

**Starting phrase: "I was awoken by sudden shaking…"**

___

Submissions are made as text posts, and to differentiate them, **a tag [MAY2020] must be added to posts to identify them as an entry.** Each user is only entitled to one per day though, so use your chance wisely! Moderators will no longer intervene; users get to decide who wins! The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!

FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION:

* Contest submissions are done as post submissions, instead of comments.

* To enter the contest, simply add the contest tag at the beginning of your story, exactly as it appears here, including the brackets:  For example, your title should appear this way: “[MAY2020] I was awoken by sudden shaking, so I went and wrote a story."

* You may only enter the contest once per day. Our new bot restricts all users to 3 posts per day. Your story counts as one of those three. Choose wisely, because once you’ve submitted your contest story for the day, it’s entered.

* Submissions which don't fit the theme will be disqualified, **including discontinuous stories.**

* **PLEASE NOTE: If you edit your story after posting it, your story will be disqualified.** If you’ve made a mistake in your story, you may delete it and post it again the following day, so double-check your stories for errors before you submit them!

* **If you add a contest tag to more than one of your three daily stories, all of them will be disqualified.**

* Winners will be decided by total upvotes. There will be a total of 10 winners. In the unlikely event of a tie, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

1st Place: A special prize from the mod team, to be announced later. A custom personal flair, and your story will receive a fancy flair as well!

2nd and 3rd Place: A custom personal flair, and a fancy flair for your story!

7 honorable mentions: Story links will appear on the winners page (linked in the sidebar)!
Contest ends on 31 May, 23 59 GMT. Good luck!

Suggestions and inquiries are welcome in the comments and modmail :)

JUNE 2020 CONTEST
We've hit another milestone: 400000 subscribers. Thank you all so much for your support over the years!

For the milestone, we're going to try something very different.

Contest: Team Tundra vs Team Desert

This contest will be played in the form of a debate. To join the contest, you must select a team and abide by its rules.

Team Tundra: Contest submissions should take place in a **tundra**.

Team Desert: Contest submissions should take place in a **desert**.

**IMPORTANT: Only users who join by 5 June 12 00 will get to choose their team. Users who join later than this will be assigned randomly.**

___

How to play:

1. To enter the contest, **(changed) reply to the corresponding threads below.** Once you do that, you can start posting your contest submissions.

2. You will also be put in a team chat. Your team will be your collaboration club, and all of you must work together to create a single story.

3. During this period, select a representative who will be free to post the story during the team submission period.

4. Once your team story is submitted, it will be pitted against the opposing team's story for the rest of the contest. It will be judged according to the amount of karma it receives, just like individual submissions.

5. If your story dominates your opponent's story for the same round in terms of karma, your team wins that round, and all of its members will be given a small boost in the final judgement of their individual stories. **If you are on a team with less people, you will be given a better boost.**

6. In the end, it's not whether your team wins that matters. Ultimately, your individual stories have to catch the hearts of your readers, just like in the previous contests.

There is one final detail that I won't disclose to you. Don't worry, it's not a crucial one, but it will be rewarding nonetheless.

___

Rules:

* **UPDATE: No bonus points will be given to you for the submission period during final judgement if you do not contribute before that submission period. For example, if John's team won 3 rounds but he only contributed in 2 of those wins, he only gets 2 bonuses. You are considered a contributor if you said something which helped the team.**

* All submissions, whether individual or team, should be in the form of a post.

* Moderators can also join a team, but they will not be able to place in the regular leaderboard for individual submissions (they have their own section).

* Abide by the r/TwoSentenceHorror rules, even while submitting your story.

* Your post must have the corresponding tag to be considered a contest submission, as described at the bottom of this post.

* No switching teams; pick a side!

* No recruiting, vote manipulation, mass downvoting, announcing details of your or your opponent's team, spying, or any actions which can be considered cheating, sabotage, or gamethrowing. Play nice, please!

* All team submissions must be submitted within the submission periods, and only one submission is allowed per period per team. Anything else will be disqualified.

___
