JULY 2020 CONTEST
The world is starting to wake back up. Welcome back to real life! Hope you're all staying sane, and I wish you all a safe reintegration! Anyways, let's get the contest started...

___

**Starting phrase: "Help me, I can't find..." (This phrase must be used in full and cannot be altered.)**

___

Submissions are made as text posts, and to differentiate them, a tag ([JULY2020]) must be added to posts to identify them as an entry. Each user is only entitled to one per day though, so use your chance wisely! Moderators will no longer intervene; users get to decide who wins! The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!

FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION: Contest submissions are done as post submissions, instead of comments.

To enter the contest, simply add the contest tag at the beginning of your story, exactly as it appears here, including the brackets: For example, your title should appear this way: "[JULY2020] Help me, I can't find..."

You may only enter the contest once per day. Our new bot restricts all users to 3 posts per day. Your story counts as one of those three. Choose wisely, because once you’ve submitted your contest story for the day, it’s entered.

Submissions which don't fit the theme will be disqualified, including discontinuous stories. Make sure your story makes complete sense.

PLEASE NOTE: If you edit your story after posting it, your story will be disqualified. If you’ve made a mistake in your story, you may delete it and post it again the following day, so double-check your stories for errors before you submit them!

If you add a contest tag to more than one of your three daily stories, all of them will be disqualified.

Winners will be decided by total upvotes. There will be a total of 10 winners. In the unlikely event of a tie, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

___

Prizes:

1st Place: A special prize from the mod team, to be announced later. A custom personal flair, and your story will receive a fancy flair as well!

2nd and 3rd Place: A custom personal flair, and a fancy flair for your story!

7 honorable mentions: Story links will appear on the winners page!

___

Contest ends on 1 August, 11 59 GMT. Good luck!

Suggestions and inquiries are welcome in the comments and modmail :)

The previous contest is currently being evaluated. Please be patient.

Sliding into her soft, moist passage, I was surrounded by warmth and felt her muscles spasm around me.

FIRST-EVER TWO-SENTENCE HORROR TOURNAMENT - CASH PRIZES - LIMITED PARTICIPANTS
**EDIT: THE CONTEST IS CLOSED FOR REGISTRATION. **

Welcome to the first-ever r/twosentencehorror tournament: Heads Up &amp; Heads Off 2020! 

**How does it work?** 

I'm glad you asked! Simply put [this is a head-up, single-elimination tournament.](https://challonge.com/Head_Up_and_Heads_Off_2020/settings) Meaning, participants will be paired up against one another (one vs. one) over multiple rounds. Everyone will have 48 hours to write the best two-sentence horror story. The winner of each pair will advance to the next round and the loser... well... OFF WITH THEIR HEAD! 

The number of participants will dictate the number of rounds. 

**Rules and formatting**

The rules are simple. Your submission must follow all Subreddit rules. Only one submission is allowed per participant. If you fail to submit or break a rule you are disqualified. 

**Formatting is very important.** If your submission is not formatted properly it may not be found during judging and will therefore be disqualified.  Each round will have a designated post flair. For example, the flair for round one will be "Round One" and so on. You must be sure to use the correct post flair; that is, use the corresponding post flair for the round you are submitting to. 

Additionally, You will have to place the number assigned to you and your opponent, in brackets, at the start of your title. For example, if you are in the 25th bracket your title should read "\[25\]" before your title/first line of your story--this is similar to the monthly contest. **This number can be seen in the bracket section of the tournament (once two or more participants have registered)**. 

**But TSC, that is a lot--what is in it for me?**

Good question! Other than bragging rights we are offering the following prizes:

*1st place:* $30 Amazon gift card, a custom user flair, and Reddit Platinum (possibly a custom award equal to Reddit Platinum). 

*2nd place:* $15 Amazon gift card and Reddit Gold.

*3rd place:* $5 Amazon gift card and Reddit Silver

**How do I register?**

This is easy and takes less than two minutes. First, create a Challonge account. Second, register for free [here](https://challonge.com/tournaments/signup/cqFX50ODpd) or by clicking "Register" on the tournament page. We will pin posts with any/all announcements and information to the r/twosentencehorror Subreddit. 

**Important note:** When you register your username must be identical to your Reddit username. If your name has been taken just let me know. 

**EDIT: If you'd like to be signed up without the hassle of creating an account simply comment "sign me up" to this post and await confirmation.**

**EDIT II: Keep in mind, it may be quicker if you sign yourself up. This will mean you're more likely to get a bye and it may ensure you get a spot (spots may fill up before I get you signed up).**

**When does it start?**

We have not yet decided on a definitive start date because we are unsure of the number of participants we will have. 

The start date is September 29th. 

**Judging**

Judging will occur in the days following the 48-hour submission period for each round. We are allowing a three day period for judging. The judges will be members of the moderator team, the community, and (possibly), guest judges. 

Mods are not allowed to participate. 

**Questions**

Post them below in the comments.

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT: MONSTER MADNESS!!
Round one announcement 

**Theme:** Monster Madness!              

**Submission deadline:** October 1st, 9PM (EST, New York)            

**BRACKETS 1-43 ONLY!!**
*Note your bracket and participant number are different. Only those in the bracket furthest to the left. The rest of you (roughly 85 of you) have a bye.*

Moving forward, you will not be mentioned/pinged--so be sure to look for the stickied post for each announcement. 
Post questions in comments. 

Monsters are one of the most basic elements of the horror genre.  

Monsters have appeared in literature for hundreds of years. Some notable monsters include Mary Shelly’s *Frankenstein* and Bram Stoker’s *Dracula*. Monsters, at least for the sake of this prompt, are living, terrestrial beings. That means they do not come from other planets (not aliens) and they are physical beings (not ghosts/spirits). 

A bit of advice: There is a plague of “it” monster stories. You’ve read them, I’m sure. “Blah blah blah. Then *it* moved.” or “Blah blah blah. I saw *it* wink.” “It”=shit. “It” is overly vague and lazy. When your antagonist is too vague it becomes less, if not--not at all, scary. Give us tentacles, tendrils, teeth, a million wondering eyes, talons, fur… Give us *something*! Other “monster” tropes that we see a lot are the parent/caregiver being described as a monster and the “humans are really the monster” tropes. That doesn’t mean you *can’t* explore these, it means that you should take them into consideration when creating an original story.

ROUND THREE ANNOUNCEMENT - HEADS UP &amp; HEADS OFF 2020!
**Theme:**  Disney inspired stories

**Deadline:** October 14th, 11PM (EST, New York) 

**BRACKETS 107-138 ONLY!!**

Many of you may have advanced beyond round three (possibly as far as round five) because many participants failed to submit and have therefore been disqualified. Just because you are not mentioned does not mean you did not advance—review the bracket!!

This round I want to see how you can turn our childhood favorites into our worst nightmares. With Disney inspired stories the keyword is *inspired.* What that means is that if you outright steal characters or other devices you will be in violation of the originality rule—we are not looking for fanfic. 

Post questions in comments. 

**NOTE: If you didn't register please don't submit or use the flair.**

[Bracket](https://challonge.com/Head\_Up\_and\_Heads\_Off\_2020)

**Schedule**

Participant advancement will be announced at the start of the submission period (outlined below).

Finals: October 29th-30th; winners announced Halloween night at 11PM

Semi-finals: October 26th-27th

Round six: October 23rd-24th

Round five: October 20th-21st

Round four: October 16th-17th

It is worth stating that I am making a big move this week (over 1,000 miles). So, the schedule is subject to change. Thanks for bearing with me!

Edit: There was initially a bracketing error on my part (many of you that did not have an opponent in Round Two were accidently disqualified when you should have gone to round three. That has since changed. Please see the bracket.
