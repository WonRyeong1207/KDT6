[Announcement] The "Almond" Situation
Many of you may have noticed the surge in "almond" related comments and the new sub r/thirdsentencealmond. It appears to have originated from this comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/comments/arqwxq/the\_realtor\_said\_the\_neighborhood\_was\_so\_safe\_no/egp8yld](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/comments/arqwxq/the_realtor_said_the_neighborhood_was_so_safe_no/egp8yld).

&amp;#x200B;

The creator of r/thirdsentencealmond has reached out to us to prevent spamming and we are currently discussing how to handle this situation in an amicable manner. The mods here would like to politely ask that you minimize or refrain from posting almond-related comments until this becomes resolved.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: By our request the creator of r/thirdsentencealmond has implemented a new rule asking users to crosspost to r/thirdsentencealmond and make your comments there. In turn, we will leave the existing almond comments alone but will remove them moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Contest: June
First off, I'd like to apologise for submitting this late. I'll extend the deadline by four days to make up for that.

Theme: *freewrite*

Restrictions: No more than seven words can be used. (Apparently there were some confusions about what is a word and what is not. A word is, obviously, one word if it exists on its own and makes sense (cat). A contraction is a word (should've). Putting two words in a collocation together (pencilcase), however, does not make it one word. However if the compound word is officially recognised (treehouse), it is accepted as one word. Hyphenated words do not count (garden-soil), even if it's just a compound word split up (hand-phone) and will be recognised as two words. And obviously if the sentence doesn't make sense whatsoever then you're not following rule 1. Hope this clears up some doubts.)

All TSH rules (refer to the sidebar) apply. No reposting, even if you made the original post before posting it here.

To win, you must get two mod votes or more, and you end up getting a 🎖️ flair.

Honorable mentions will be given if you get one mod vote, granting you a 🎃 flair.

Please note that blatant and serious rule breaking anywhere on the subreddit will completely erase your flairs in addition to the respective disciplinary actions, if you have any.

If your contest submission is removed, don't worry, you can submit another one, as long as it now follows the rules.

You can only submit one entry.

This contest lasts from Thu 27 Jun (12nn) to Mon 7 Jul (12nn). Contest is **closed** and undergoing evaluation by mods.

For any inquiries, please feel free to write to our modmail by writing a private message to r/TwoSentenceHorror.
