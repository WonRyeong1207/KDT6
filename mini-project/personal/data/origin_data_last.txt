DECEMBER ANNOUNCEMENT + NOVEMBER WINNERS
Hey horror horde, it's me, the mintiest of clicks, back at it again. What a year it's been! In 2022, we hit 1 million subs, were brigaded with trolls on trolls on trolls, obtained a cult leader, and devised a way to control minds through a series of random words frantic arid refrigerator tantalizing sanctuary.

Enough about how you're all now under our spell, and onto...

# ANNOUNCEMENTS

* We say it every month, but please visit the sidebar and read our rules and wiki! Quick reminders:
   * Two sentences OR LESS. So one sentence stories are allowed as long as it's not a gimmick. And regardless of grammar, if it's more than two sentences, it'll be removed!
   * It hurts us more than it hurts you when we remove a story for overused tropes, so please review the [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules/overused_tropes) and fight us back hard if you disagree in [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror) (but not too hard)!
* Don't troll or spam, don't be a jerk, don't plagiarize, and don't intentionally post stories that are low quality/low effort! All of these things may result in a permaban! Read up on our [Three Strikes and you're out](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules/#wiki_red_dot_warnings.3A) rule (note, plagiarism is a once-and-you-are-permabanned ban!)
* You see something you think breaks the rules? Report the story! Snitches get riches, or something like that.

# December 2022 Contest Prompt

We did the whole Christmas theme last year or the year before or the year before. Who knows? Don't you feel like you do the same thing over and over with no escape? Let's celebrate that existential crisis! 

The theme this month is "**escape**". Stories must begin with \[DEC22\] and contain a variation of the word **escape** (e.g., escaping, escaped, etc.)

Properly formatted contest December 2022 examples:

&gt;\[DEC22\] I'll never escape. This is my second sentence.  
\[Dec22\] This may be my first sentence. I escaped getting banned.

Improperly formatted contest November 2022 examples:

&gt;\[Dec2022\] The tag is not correct. I can't escape my inability to follow rules.  
In \[DEC22\], I got the tag right, but it's not at the beginning. I also don't mention the theme at all.

**December Contest Rules**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions  that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of  the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries  that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to  fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting,  language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners  will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a  tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

*1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places*:  You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the  2SH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your  flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning  stories.

*7 honorable mentions*: Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

*Contest ends on December 31, 2022 @ 11:59pm (GMT)*

Any questions should be made below in the comments, within our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6), or a note on [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror).

JANUARY ANNOUNCEMENT + DECEMBER WINNERS
Hello all, and welcome to another year on this wonderful planet we call Earth! As we march ever-long into the inky blackness of space, many take time to reflect on their lives.

Please contact me for more information! I hope you all had a wonderful Festival of the Frigid Night and that the Man Who Haunts Your Dreams and Wishes treated you very well!

## ANNOUNCEMENTS

* If you see something, say something! If you see a post that you think breaks the rules, don't just make a comment and hope that the mods get to it; report it! It's the only way to guarantee that a moderator puts eyes on the story.
* Please make sure to visit our sidebar and read our rules in detail! Some quick reminders:
   * Stories must stand on their own without required knowledge of another piece of media. This means that you can write a story about some obscure cryptid *as long as the story is still scary without the reader knowing what the cryptid is/does*.
   * Two sentences **OR LESS.** One sentence stories are allowed!
* Don't troll or spam, don't be a jerk, don't plagiarize, and don't intentionally post stories that are low quality/low effort! All of these things may result in a permaban! Read up on our [Three Strikes and you're out rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules/#wiki_red_dot_warnings.3A) (note, plagiarism is a once-and-you-are-permabanned ban!)

## JANUARY 2023 Contest Prompt

January is named after Janus, the Roman god of beginnings, doorways, transitions, and endings. He is also the origin the term "two-faced," which describes a duplicitous and deceitful person.

The theme of this month is "**two-faced**". Stories must begin with \[JAN23\] and contain the word **two-faced**. This could be in the idiomatic meaning of being a liar, or could be the more literal interpretation. Get creative :)

Properly formatted January 2023 examples:

&gt;\[JAN23\] "That two-faced jerk!" I almost didn't write a second sentence.   
&gt;  
&gt;\[Jan23\] There's something wrong with the cow. It's two-faced!

Improperly formatted examples:

&gt;\[January2023\] This tag isn't right. I'm not sure what two-faced means anyway.   
&gt;  
&gt;In \[JAN23\], I got the tag right, but it's not at the beginning. I also didn't mention the theme at all.

**January Contest Rules**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no re-purposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting, language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places: You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the 2SH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.

7 honorable mentions: Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

Contest ends on January 31, 2022 @ 11:59pm (GMT)

Any questions should be made below in the comments, within our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6), or a note on [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror).

FEBRUARY ANNOUNCEMENT + JANUARY WINNERS
Hello again, faithful followers! You all kicked off 2023 with a series of horrifying stories featuring liars, betrayals, and monsters of the two-faced variety. I have come once again, your ~~worshipful cult leader~~ subreddit moderator, to announce the winners of last months contest and reveal the theme for the new month!

But first, a few announcements and reminders...

## ANNOUNCEMENTS

* If you see something, say something! If you see a post that you think breaks the rules, don't just make a comment and hope that the mods get to it; report it! It's the only way to guarantee that a moderator puts eyes on the story.
* Oppression (racism, transphobia, homophobia, etc), while horrifying, is starting to become an overused trope, so if you decide to use it in your story, make sure it's especially unique.
* While we understand the temptation to use ChatGPT, one of our rules is that the stories you submit must be written by *you*. If we find you've been using it to generate stories, the posts will be removed under Rule 5: Be Original.
* Don't troll or spam, don't be a jerk, don't plagiarize, and don't intentionally post stories that are low quality/low effort! All of these things may result in a permaban! Read up on our [Three Strikes and you're out rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules/#wiki_red_dot_warnings.3A) (note, plagiarism is a once-and-you-are-permabanned ban!)

## FEBRUARY 2023 Contest Prompt

&gt;"The rules of fair play do not apply in love and war." - *Euphues* by John Lyly

February is known as the month of love. It's the month where Cupid comes down from the heavens and strikes love into the hearts of his victims. Sometimes, however, those he strikes are already in relationships, and in their partners we find not love...but murder. After all, *all's fair in love and war.*

The theme for this month is "**love and war**". Stories must begin with \[FEB23\] and contain **either** the word **love** or the word **war**. There are no bonus points for using both, but know that I, personally, will be impressed.

Properly formatted February 2023 examples:

&gt;\[FEB23\] "I love killing," said the murderer. This is the second sentence.   
&gt;  
&gt;\[Feb23\] War? War never changes.

Improperly formatted examples:

&gt;\[February2023\] This tag isn't right. I love contests though.   
&gt;  
&gt;In \[Feb23\], I got the tag right, but it's not at the beginning. I also didn't mention the theme at all.

**February Contest Rules**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting, language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

* 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places: You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the TSH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.
* 7 honorable mentions: Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

Contest ends on February 28, 2023 @ 11:59pm (GMT)

Any questions should be made below in the comments, within our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6), or a note on [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror).

Check out January's winners in the comment below!

MARCH ANNOUNCEMENT + FEBRUARY WINNERS
Time often feels like it *march*es on a little too fast!

I sincerely apologize for my lateness, my faithful followers. I must have mixed up the Gregorian calendar and the Runic calendar. I am currently working on my own superior calendar that will fix all the problems of those other calendars, so stay tuned for that.

Now where were we...

## ANNOUNCEMENTS

* We've recently had a bit of a wave of trolling and of intentionally low-quality posts, so we've had to temporarily re-instate our no-tolerance, immediate ban rules. It seems that the wave has essentially died down. If you were banned in the past week or two and feel that it was in error or that you made a mistake, please reach out via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror) and get yourself re-instated.
* If you see something, say something! **If you see a post that you think breaks the rules, don't just make a comment and hope that the mods get to it; report it!** It's the only way to guarantee that a moderator puts eyes on the story.
* While we understand the temptation to use ChatGPT, one of our rules is that the stories you submit must be written by *you*. If we find you've been using ChatGPT to generate stories, the posts will be removed under Rule 5: Be Original.
* Don't troll or spam, don't be a jerk, don't plagiarize, and don't intentionally post stories that are low quality/low effort! All of these things may result in a permaban! Read up on our [Three Strikes and you're out rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules/#wiki_red_dot_warnings.3A) (note, plagiarism is a once-and-you-are-permabanned ban!)
* Just because a sentence is long doesn't mean that it's a run-on sentence, and just because you used a comma instead of a period, doesn't mean it's a single sentence.

## MARCH 2023 Contest Prompt

There are many things to love about March, as the weather begins to turn from the ice of winter and we can start ~~performing our animal sacrifices outside~~ shedding a few layers of clothing. March was named after Mars, the Roman god of war. But we've already done a Roman god, and last month's prompt included "war," so let us look to another religion for our theme.

St.Patrick's Day falls on March 17th and is a favorite of the Irish and those who love Guinness, shillelagh, corned beef, the college of Notre Dame, and the color green. What is St. Patrick most famous for? That's right, driving the snakes out of Ireland!

The theme for this month is **snake**. You may refer to the animal, a mythical creature, or a traitorous person. You must use the word "snake" or one of its other parts of speech ("snaking", "snakes"). You may also use the word "serpent."

Properly formatted March 2023 examples:

&gt;\[MAR23\] The snake snaked stealthily. This is the second sentence. 

&gt;\[Mar23\] I swear, it happens every time I get on a plane. Why does it always have to be snakes?

Improperly formatted examples:

&gt;\[March2023\] This tag isn't right. I own three pet snakes.

&gt;In \[Mar23\], I got the tag right, but it's not at the beginning. I also didn't mention the theme at all.

**March Contest Rules**

* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.
* Entries that are edited after submission may be disqualified. If you edit it to fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting, language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

* 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places: You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the TSH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.
* 7 honorable mentions: Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

Contest ends on March 31, 2023 @ 11:59pm (GMT)

Any questions should be made below in the comments, within our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6), or a note on [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror).
