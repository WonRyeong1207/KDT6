Before my parents left town for the weekend, they tucked me in, locked my bedroom door, and told me that there was nothing to be afraid of: the monsters had no way of getting inside the house.

Every night he slips into my bed, his heavy body pressing a dent into the mattress, the smell of his breath and sweat making me cringe, his snoring like the repetitive chugging of a chainsaw...
I've asked him repeatedly to leave but he never seems to hear me, perhaps because, ever since he paid £3000 dollars at auction for the "haunted bed", he's had the - false - idea that it is his.

The incubus gave one last, delirious shudder then rolled off the teenage girl who lay, gasping, in her pink bed...
