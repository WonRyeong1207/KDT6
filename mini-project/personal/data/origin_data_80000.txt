Now for the fun:

# SEPTEMBER 2021 CONTEST &amp; RULES:

With schools opening back up and students entering another unprecedented year of learning, I figure it's best to commemorate it with some horrifying tales of education!

For September's contest, your story must contain this tag as the very first part of the title **\[SEP21\]** and the **theme of education**. You do not need to use the word "education," just needs to revolve around that theme.

**Properly formatted contest September 2021 example:**

&gt;\[SEP21\] There was something we learned as the first sentence. This is the second sentence.

or

&gt;\[SEP21\] This is the first sentence. I went to school in the second sentence.

**Improperly formatted contest September 2021 examples that will be removed:**

&gt;\[SEPT21\] I put education in the first sentence. However, the proper tag is \[SEP21\] **not \[SEPT21\], (SEP21) or \[SEP(space)21\].**

or

&gt;No reference to the theme \[SEP21\]. The tag is not the very first part of the first sentence, nor did it reference the theme.

**SEPTEMBER CONTEST RULES:**

* You may submit **ONLY one contest entry per day.** Remember: our bot restricts all users to three (3) posts per 24 hours (this includes any stories that have been removed or deleted). Your story counts as one of those!
* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
* Entries that are edited after submission will be disqualified. If you edit it to fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting, language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

**1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places:** You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the 2SH community! And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.

**7 honorable mentions**: Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

**Contest ends on September 30, 2021 @ 11:59pm (GMT)**

Any questions should be made below in the comments, or you may send us a note on [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror).

   * Stories must stand on their own without specific prior knowledge of any fandom (i.e., no fan-fiction horror) or any real-world event (i.e., simple references to horrific real-world events without explanation will not count as a story)
* Please check out the sidebar, read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules) wiki, hit up our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6) or write into [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror) if you have sub related questions
* As always, trolling/spamming, sexualizing minors, and jerk behavior will result in a 🔴 in our three dots and you're permabanned system (mods have the discretion to skip the second 🔴altogether if the violation is severe).
   * Remember, **Plagiarism will result in a permaban!**
   * If you have a 🔴and have been chill for around 90 days, write into modmail and we can review to remove your strikes.

Now for the fun:

# OCTOBER 2021 CONTEST &amp; RULES:

Where do most people go to celebrate Halloween? Trick-or-treating? Haunted houses? Naw, the cool kids go to carnivals and fairs (or at least that's what my mom always told me).

For October's contest, your story must contain this tag as the very first part of the title **\[OCT21\]** and the **theme of carnivals or fairs**. You do not need to use the word "carnival" or "fair", it just needs to revolve around the theme.

**Properly formatted contest September 2021 example:**

&gt;\[OCT21\] The carnie did something scary as the first sentence. This is the second sentence.

or

&gt;\[OCT21\] This is the first sentence. I went to the fair in the second sentence.

**Improperly formatted contest September 2021 examples that will be removed:**

&gt;\[OCTO21\] I went to the carnival in first sentence. However, the proper tag is \[OCT21\] **not \[OCTO21\], (OCT21) or \[SEP(space)21\].**

or

&gt;No reference to the theme \[OCT21\]. The tag is not the very first part of the first sentence, nor did it reference the theme.

**OCTOBER CONTEST RULES:**

* You may submit **ONLY one contest entry per day.** Remember: our bot restricts all users to three (3) posts per 24 hours (this includes any stories that have been removed or deleted). Your story counts as one of those!
* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!
   * NEW RULE FOR OCTOBER'S WINNERS -- **THE SUGAR SOAD** **Rule:**
      * **Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of their entries will be their winner** (you all can thank u/sugar-soad for killing it every contest!)
* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).
* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
* Entries that are edited after submission will be disqualified. If you edit it to fix a typo, that should be fine; if you edit to fix formatting, language, or plot, it is up to the mod's discretion to remove.
* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.

**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**

**1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places:** You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the 2SH community! And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.

**7 honorable mentions**: Story links will be featured on next month’s announcement!

**Contest ends on October 31, 2021 @ 11:59pm (GMT)**

Any questions should be made below in the comments, or you may send us a note on [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror).

# NOVEMBER 2021 CONTEST &amp; RULES:

Now that spooky season is over, sleepy season begins. With the cold and winter and seasonal affective disorder (S.A.D.) upon us, what better way to celebrate than having a contest revolving around crazy long naps.

For November's contest, your story must contain this tag as the very first part of the title **\[NOV21\]** and the word (or variation of the word) **"hibernation."**  Your story must include the word hibernation, hibernate, etc. to qualify.

**Properly formatted contest November 2021 example:**

&gt;\[NOV21\] The bear hibernated in the first sentence. This is the second sentence.

or

&gt;\[NOV21\] This is the first sentence. The bear hibernates in the second sentence.

**Improperly formatted contest November 2021 examples that will be removed:**

&gt;\[NOVEMBER21\] I hibernated in first sentence. However, the proper tag is \[NOV21\] **not \[NOVEMBER21\], (NOV21) or \[NOV(space)21\].**
