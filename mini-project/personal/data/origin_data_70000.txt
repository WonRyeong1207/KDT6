APRIL ANNOUNCEMENT &amp; CONTEST + MARCH WINNERS!
Happy April Fool's, my horror friends (or should I say, April "GHOULS"? No. No, I shouldn't).

Our community has grown exponentially since the beginning of 2021, so just to reiterate some of our most important rules and clarify some of the existing ones, check out below:

# ANNOUNCEMENTS - Please read the sidebar and wiki for all [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules)

* To clarify what **Be two sentences (or less)** means -- Yes, you could have one sentence stories. No, just because you use commas or semi-colons instead of where periods should be, it does not count as only two sentences. And yes, **dialogue is considered against your sentence count.**
* With your help, our [Avoid Overused Trope wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules/overused_tropes) has been updated. Remember that this is not a full, exhaustive list of every trope we consider, but should offer transparency on why your story may have been removed for being a trope.
* **Bans and The Three-Strike Flair System**
   * Plagiarism still results in a permaban - no second chances. All stories must be original!
   * Stories around sexualizing of a minor (SOAM) are still prohibited. In the past, we applied this flair ( 🖍 ) and a temp ban, but have now incorporated SOAM stories into our current, standard three-strike flair system without applying an immediate temp ban.
   * **The three-strike flair system** is only for users who violate Reddit and our sub's community guidelines (not necessarily for breaking a simple sub rule - i.e., we won't give you a strike for having more than two sentences in a story). These flairs are applied to ensure we keep our community an actual  community. It's up to the reviewing mod's discretion of when to apply:
      * 🔴 = Typically given for SOAM, trolling, spamming, etc.
      * 🔴  🔴 = second warning if the user continues to violate guidelines
      * Three strikes and it's a permaban!

Whew. Now that the boring stuff is out of the way...

Some stories may get passed our glazed-over eyes, so you can help us by reporting stories to help us action quicker.

# JUNE 2021 CONTEST &amp; RULES:

It's been said that "*For they say when you marry in June you will always be a bride.*" Probably a weird thing to say to grooms, but with that lovely sentiment in mind, we figure you all can destroy it with some horror.

Your story must contain this tag as the very first part of the title: **\[JUN21\]**, and the theme is **WEDDINGS.** You don't need to include the word "wedding" in the story; it just must be about a wedding!

**Properly formatted contest June 2021 example:**

&gt;\[JUN21\] A marriage, wedding, or equivalent cultural union occurred in the first sentence. This is the second sentence.

or

&gt;\[JUN21\] This is the first sentence. A groom and bride are in the second sentence.

**Improperly formatted contest June 2021 examples:**

&gt;\[JUNE21\] A marriage occurred in the first sentence. The proper tag is \[JUN21\] not \[JUN**E**21\].

or

&gt;Wedding is the first sentence \[JUN21\]. The tag is not the very first part of the first sentence.

# JUNE CONTEST RULES:

* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.
   * The focus of your contest entry should be around weddings. If the horror focuses solely on **prejudice or unacceptance because the nature of the wedding,** it will be disqualified and removed.
   * If the horror focuses on **child or underaged weddings**, it will be disqualified, removed, AND is subject to our sexualizing of a minor rule (Rule 10) which results in a 🔴
* Entries that are edited after submission will be disqualified.

# JULY 2021 CONTEST &amp; RULES:

Flash floods, record-setting heat and ridiculous cold, decapitated-baby-head-sized hail? What is going on with this odd weather?

You tell us! For July's contest, your story must contain this tag as the very first part of the title **\[JUL21\]** and the theme is **odd weather**.

**Properly formatted contest July 2021 example:**

&gt;\[JUL21\] Weird, scary weather happened in the first sentence. This is the second sentence.

or

&gt;\[JUL21\] This is the first sentence. It was raining inside is the second sentence.

**Improperly formatted contest** **July 2021 examples that will be removed:**

&gt;\[JULY21\] Weather did things in the first sentence. The proper tag is \[JUL21\] not \[JULY21\] nor \[JUL 21\].

or

&gt;Doing things in the first sentence \[JUL21\]. The tag is not the very first part of the first sentence, nor did it reference odd weather.

We've been asked why the sub didn't do a celebration when we hit 666k members. Well, to us, EVERY DAY is a celebration to the horrifying, macabre, and devastatingly devious! Also, by the time we realized, we were rounding 671k members so, meh.

# ANNOUNCEMENTS

* Lately we've seen an uptick of wordy submissions that are *technically* two sentences but hover on being two paragraphs. The point of the sub is to be scary and concise. 
   * To emphasize a part of Rule #2, "Sentences are not defined by punctuation. **If the story reads as more than two sentences,** it will be removed."
* Read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules), hit up our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6) or write into [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror) if you have sub related questions, and don't violate the baddie rules (i.e., trolling/spamming, sexualizing minors, borderline plagiarism) or get slapped with the wretched 🔴. 
   * Three strikes, you're permabanned! If you have a 🔴and have been chill for around 90 days, write into modmail and we can review to remove your strikes. **Straight up plagiarism will result in a permaban!**

# AUGUST 2021 CONTEST &amp; RULES:

**Properly formatted contest August 2021 example:**

&gt;\[AUG21\] There was a punishing sentence as the first sentence. This is the second sentence.

or
